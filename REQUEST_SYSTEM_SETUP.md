# Customer Request System - Setup Complete ✅

## Overview
Your Customer Request System has been successfully implemented using the same Gmail service configuration as your contact page.

## What Was Created

### 1. **RequestForm Component** (`components/RequestForm.tsx`)
- Full Name input field
- Email Address input field
- Contact Number / WhatsApp input field
- Type of Request dropdown (Software Installation, Game Installation, Windows Repair, Remote Assistance, Other)
- Device Type dropdown (Laptop, Desktop, Other)
- Detailed Message textarea
- Form validation with smooth focus animations
- Success popup: "✅ Your request was sent successfully!"
- Error popup: "⚠️ [Error message]"
- Matches your website's futuristic techy style

### 2. **API Route** (`app/api/request/route.ts`)
- Uses the same Gmail service configuration as your contact page
- Sends **two emails** on form submission:
  
  **Email to Admin (aacomputerremoteservices@gmail.com):**
  - Subject: "New Customer Request - [Type of Request]"
  - Contains all form details in the dark-themed template you provided
  - Includes customer's email as reply-to address
  
  **Confirmation Email to Customer:**
  - Subject: "Request Confirmation - [Type of Request]"
  - Personalized thank you message
  - Confirms receipt of their request
  - Uses the dark-themed template you provided

### 3. **Request Page** (`app/request/page.tsx`)
- New dedicated page at `/request`
- Follows your website's futuristic design
- Includes:
  - Hero section with gradient text
  - Social media buttons
  - Request form in a card layout
  - "What Happens Next?" information panel
  - "Services We Offer" list
  - Responsive grid layout matching your contact page

### 4. **Navigation Update** (`components/Navigation.tsx`)
- Added "Request" link to the navbar
- Positioned between "Products" and "Contact"
- Works on both desktop and mobile views

## Email Configuration

The system uses your existing Gmail configuration from `.env`:

```env
EMAIL_USER=aacomputerremoteservices@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password_here
```

**Important:** Make sure these environment variables are set in your `.env` file (not `.env.example`).

## How It Works

1. **Customer fills out the form** on `/request` page
2. **Form validates** all required fields
3. **Two emails are sent simultaneously:**
   - One to your Gmail with all request details
   - One confirmation email to the customer
4. **Success message** appears: "✅ Your request was sent successfully!"
5. **Form resets** automatically after successful submission

## Email Templates

Both emails use the dark-themed templates you provided:
- Background: `#0b0b0b`
- Primary color: `#00bcd4` (cyan)
- Text color: `#e0e0e0`
- Message box: `#121212`

## Features Implemented

✅ All required form fields with validation  
✅ Dropdown menus for request type and device type  
✅ Smooth focus animations on inputs  
✅ Success and error popups with icons  
✅ Dual email functionality (admin + customer)  
✅ Formatted HTML email templates  
✅ Futuristic design matching your website  
✅ Responsive layout  
✅ New navbar link  
✅ No backend or database required  
✅ Uses existing Gmail service configuration  

## Testing

To test the system:

1. Make sure your `.env` file has the correct Gmail credentials
2. Run your development server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/request` or click "Request" in the navbar
4. Fill out and submit the form
5. Check your Gmail for the admin email
6. Check the customer's email for the confirmation

## Notes

- The system reuses your existing `nodemailer` setup
- No additional dependencies needed
- Form data is not stored anywhere (as requested)
- Both emails are sent using `Promise.all()` for efficiency
- The customer receives an automated confirmation they should not reply to
- Your admin email includes the customer's email as reply-to for easy responses
