## üöÄ Performance

All animations are optimized for performance:

- Minimal re-renders
- Lazy loading for images
- Efficient state management
- No layout shifts

## üì± Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive:
- Mobile navigation with theme toggle
- Adaptive layouts for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly hover states
- Optimized for phones, tablets, and desktops

## üîß Customization

### Change Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.ts` to modify the color palette:
```typescript
colors: {
  "tech-cyan": "#00bcd4",     // Change this
  "cyan-glow": "#1de9b6",     // Change this
  // ... more colors
}
```

### Adjust Animation Speed
Edit component files to modify animation durations:
- `SplashIntro.tsx` - Boot sequence timing
- `ScrollReveal.tsx` - Scroll reveal speed
- `ProductCard.tsx` - Hover animation speed

### Disable Splash Screen
In `SplashIntro.tsx`, change:
```typescript
const splashShown = sessionStorage.getItem("splashShown");
```
To:
```typescript
const splashShown = "true"; // Always skip
```

## üì¶ New Dependencies

- **framer-motion**: For advanced animations (already installed)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** on different browsers and devices
2. **Customize colors** if needed to match your brand
3. **Add content** - all pages are ready for your content
4. **Deploy** when you're happy with the results

## üí° Tips

- The splash screen only shows once per session - to see it again, clear session storage or use incognito mode
- Dark mode is the default - users can switch to light mode anytime
- All animations can be disabled in browser settings (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- The theme toggle works on all pages simultaneously

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Splash screen not showing?
- Clear session storage in DevTools
- Check browser console for errors

### Theme toggle not working?
- Check localStorage permissions
- Verify JavaScript is enabled

### Animations choppy?
- Check GPU acceleration is enabled
- Close other heavy applications
- Test in different browser

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues or need modifications:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Review the component files
3. Test in incognito mode to rule out cache issues
